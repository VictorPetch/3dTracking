# 3dTracking
This is basically my attempt at reproducing 3d tracking motion using an ESP8266 and a MPU6050. Ideally, it will be used for gaming purposes. Actuall I'm thinking more of a motion tracking than a 3d position tracking. I know that using only the sensors have it's limitations. Based on what I searched, orientation tracking isn't going to be a problem, however since we're using acelerometers, predicting the 3d position is going to be a problem. Though, I believe movement can be simplified for gaming purposes and we don't actually need perfect 3d tracking. If I can estimate movements such as: punching, moving arms in a certain pattern, etc, that is a win for me, considering I'm using 20 dollars hardware (50-60 Reais).
